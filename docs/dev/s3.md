# Accessing S3 buckets

S3 buckets are currently created per-environment.

The easiest way to look at the contents of a S3 bucket is to mount it locally (this is exactly what Drupal does in the staging and production environments so that uploads can go directly to S3). We use [s3fs-fuse](https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse) for this purpose.

To mount S3, you need the relevant settings from the application. As an example, to grab the S3 information from staging:

    cf env weathergov-staging | sed -n '/VCAP_SERVICES/,/VCAP_APPLICATION/p' |  sed '$d' |  sed '1s;^;{\n;' | sed '$s/$/}/' | sed 's/VCAP_SERVICES/"VCAP_SERVICES"/g' | jq ".VCAP_SERVICES.s3"

Set your `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` temporarily to the above S3 credentials (using bash)

    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=foo
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=bar

Finally, mount using the S3 bucket name and explicitly specify the host:

    mkdir s3fsmount/
    s3fs cg-bucket-name-goes-here -o host=https://s3-us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com s3fsmount/

**Note**: you should never write to S3 buckets. This is for visibility and debugging purposes only.

Do not forget to `s3fs umount s3fsmount/` when done.
