### Ongoing priorities

- Each of these priorities will have time for research, prototyping, scoping, design, development, and testing as needed
- 50% of our bandwidth is devoted to planned work in the roadmap and 50% to iterations, debt, bugs, and docs
- Acquisition and security compliance work streams are coordinated against this roadmap
- Accessibility, code quality, security, reliability, consistency, and responsive design are continuously monitored and maintained


## Risks

- Scaling operations across NWS
- Tackling the other 40K pages and products
- Coordination with API development
- Maintaining trust, credibility, and integrity

## Outcomes
- **By the end of Sept 2025**:
  - The team is delivering and measuring value

  - The public and partners can easily find relevant information
  - The public and partners feel confident that they can understand the information
  - Public feel confident they can use the information
  - Partner feels confident they can use the information
  - Forecasters are spending the same or less time* and effort supporting the site
  - Forecasters at any level of technical skill or comfort are using the CMS to author content
  - The new weather.gov is a primary source to use in the future
 
- **By the end of Sept 2026 (in addition to the previous goals)**:
  - Weather information is available for any location within the US
  - Forecasters are authoring content through CMS
  - The site and CMS are reliable
  - Site maintains integrity and credibility
  - Increase use of NWS data, products, and services with partners
