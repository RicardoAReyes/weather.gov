## Public
### Defining the general public
All are at risk of experiencing weather hazards, whether it’s a snowstorm, tornado, hurricane or wildfire. 
While we don’t all have the same resources or abilities, some of the challenges with the existing experience impact many groups. For example, when weather information uses technical language, it makes it harder for many folks without the expertise to interpret.
But for folks with disabilities, low literacy and less resources, these challenges are magnified.

### What dimensions impact what the “public” needs? 

- A person’s understanding of weather information generally (ie weather expertise)
- Past experience with the specific weather hazard
- Access to technology / internet during a weather hazard
- Learning preferences (numbers, words, visuals)
- Physical, cognitive and language barriers to interpreting weather information
- Physical barriers to responding to weather information
