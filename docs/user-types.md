## Public
### Defining the general public
All are at risk of experiencing weather hazards, whether it’s a snowstorm, tornado, hurricane or wildfire. 
While we don’t all have the same resources or abilities, some of the challenges with the existing experience impact many groups. For example, when weather information uses technical language, it makes it harder for many folks without the expertise to interpret.
But for folks with disabilities, low literacy and less resources, these challenges are magnified.

### What dimensions impact what the “public” needs? 

- Low literacy of weather information (ie non-weather expert)
    - Weather terms and concepts both simple and complex leave many folks confused, while others have a working understanding.
    - What do they need?
Providing definitions, explanations and examples of weather terms and metrics.
 For example, visuals of what “1in rain in an hour” or “30 mph wind” look like that don’t assume prior knowledge. 


- Past experience with the specific weather hazard
   - If a tornado hits Nashville, a person who has lived their whole life in Tennessee needs something very different than a person who recently moved from NY.
   - What do they need? Folks with experience with a hazard have their own understanding of how to stay safe, and may or may not be interested in learning more. Folks who have never experienced the hazard are most interested in safety information and guidance. 


- Physical, cognitive and language barriers to interpreting weather information
    - There are a variety of differences that make it harder to access and interpret weather information. This applies to those with obvious differences such as blindness, but also in terms of learning styles.
        - Auditory
        - Cognitive, learning, and neurological
        - Physical
        - Speech
        - Visual
    - What do they need?
        - Screen reader support and optimization
        - Multi-language support
        - Multiple formats of information such as video and visual option

- Access to technology / internet during a weather hazard
    - A website is only useful if folks can actually access it. Particularly in a hazard, many folks lose access to reliable internet - and many lack access to begin with. But internet access isn’t a binary - often folks may have some, limited access, just not enough to load lots of fancy graphics.
    - What do they need? A website should only ever be one way that people can receive critical information about a weather hazard. Additionally, ensuring that low-bandwidth users are able to access is critical - so that folks with just a tiny bit of service can get what they need, quickly. 

- Physical barriers to responding to weather information
  - There are many reasons folks are unable to respond in a hazard. Some include:
    - Ability to independently walk and/or drive during an emergency
    - Lack of funds and/or resources to move or stay sheltered
    - Lack of safe housing
  - What do they need? 
    - Safety guidance that acknowledges differences in ability.

## Partners

Our team has a broad definition of a "partner" as anyone that is in a leadership position making decisions that have impact beyond their friend and family. 

This includes both traditional "core" partners such as Emergency managers, school leaders and transit, as well as community based organizations and businesses that make decisions for their staff and community. 

### Goals
- Understand weather in order to plan ahead and make decisions to protect life and property
- Keep those within their organization, including staff, safe during an emergency
- Communicate situation to others, who may have less weather expertise

### During a Hazard
- Before: Monitor the weather, be prepared
- During: Varies across roles. Focused on communicating of weather information and impacts. - -- Make decisions as needed. 
- After: Varies across roles. Deal with damage and prepare for the next event. 

### General challenges
- Multiple information sources
- Disparate sources of real time data
- Lots of data and technical jargon
- For partners that cover a bigger area (ie state), hard to see all the various hazards
- Some weather can lack clear signs, hard to know when to prepare without “crying wolf”
- WFO lines create challenges, relationships fill in the gaps

### What do they need?
- Actionable, high level information on timing, severity
- Understand the geographic location of the hazard, direction and real time data points
- Understand precise timing of the storm in order to make time related decisions, such as delaying a school start or canceling an event.
- Needs to understand exactly what will happen at the location/s that they manages.
-----------------------------------------------------
## Forecasters

Forecasters communicate weather, especially hazard weather, clearly to the public and emergency management partners.

### Goals
- Desire to support local partners
- Desire to innovate and improve

### Responsibilities during hazards
- Communicating weather information effectively to partners and the general public
- Building relationships with local and regional partners
- Managing forecast packages
- Sending out alerts and warnings in a hazard

### Existing challenges
- Have to use multiple systems (AWIPs, CMS, etc) that don’t work well together
- Depending on how much WFO has automated, varying levels of manual tasks to produce forecast, push data, etc

-----------------------------------------------------

## Tech leads

### Goals
ITOs and webmasters support WFO and regional offices in maintaining the website and other aspects of the tech stack

### Responsibilities during hazards
- Keep the website up and running
- Support forecasters and partners by “customizing” the website via the CMS
- Build out scripts to automate things like pushing data from AWIPs to API/website, ingesting data, producing graphics from AWIPs

### Existing challenges
- Tech stack is prone to breaking
- Limited time and resources - it’s not a full time job.
- Have to use code and train others to in order to accomplish goals

### Opportunities

- Empower them to train forecasters on content governance, new website, etc
- Give them time back from making sure the website doesn’t crash
