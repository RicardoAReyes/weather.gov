Gusts could occasionally be\nclose to 30 mph. This will result in the continued drying of fine\nfuels.\n\nResidents and visitors are urged to exercise caution if handling\nopen flames or equipment that creates sparks. Also, dispose of\ncigarette butts, matches, and other flammable items in appropriate\ncontainers. Keep vehicles off of dry grass and obey local burn bans.\nMost dry grasses, dead leaves, and other tree litter could easily\nignite and spread fire quickly.\n\nFor more information about wildfire danger, burn restrictions,\nand wildfire prevention and education, please visit your state's\nforestry or environmental protection website.",
