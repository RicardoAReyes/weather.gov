High pressure \ngradually builds across through mid week. High pressure will \nremain the predominate feature Thursday through much of the \nweekend. High pressure may lose hold as weak low pressure passes\nto our north late Sunday into early next week.\n\n&&\n\n.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...\nMain change this update was to decrease cloud cover today. This\nseems prudent with a strong inversion at 800 mb and dry low-\nlevels. In addition, upper low may be well enough north to \nlimit stratcu development. \n\nOtherwise, the upper low drops into northern NY state later \ntoday. The lower and middle levels by and large will continue to\ndry out with a noticeably drier NW flow regime setting up \nacross the area. The most noticeable change is the lowering of \ndew points across the region from west to east throughout today \nand into tonight. Dew points fall into the much more comfortable\n40s and 50s today. Highs are forecast to get into the upper 60s\nand lower 70s, with spots in an around the NYC metro a bit \nwarmer. This is about 5 to 10 degrees below average. The lower \nlevels should be dry enough for today into tonight to preclude \nany rain shower activity despite some spokes of upper level \nenergy from the upper level low swinging through.\n\n&&\n\n.SHORT TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/...\nThe upper and mid level trough axis will swing through during \nWednesday. Despite this, predominantly dry weather continues \nfor the mid week. There is only a slight chance of a few widely\nscattered showers for mainly northern locations Wed afternoon.\nOtherwise, mainly just some low level fair weather clouds can \nbe expected from time to time with the lower and mid levels \nbeing relatively dry and synoptic scale sinking motion \nincreasing overall as high pressure will continue to gradually \nbuild from the west. Dew point readings will remain in the \ncomfortable 50s providing seasonably cool weather for this time \nof year. Day time temperatures will be close to 10 degrees below\naverage Wednesday with mainly lower and middle 70s for day time\nmaxes, and temperatures Wednesday night running below average \nwith night time mins in the lower 50s across the interior and \nupper 50s closer to the coast.\n\n&&\n\n.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...\nNo significant changes in the long term and stuck fairly close to \nprevious forecast/NBM. \n\nSurface high pressure builds into the region from the Great Lakes on \nThursday and remains in place through much of the weekend. This will \nlead to an extended period of dry weather. A trough exits to the \neast late Thursday and early Friday as a ridge takes over. This will \nlead to gradually warming temperatures. NW flow continues on \nThursday under high pressure keep high temperatures in the upper to \nlow 70s. Upper 70s to lower 80s return on Friday as ridging builds \naloft and surface winds become more westerly, eventually \nsouthwesterly by the afternoon. Westerly to southerly flow continues \ninto the weekend allowing for further warming with highs in the \nlow/mid-80s. \n\nGlobal models are not in a consensus late Sunday into Monday. The \nGFS has a trough develop over the area while the ECMWF have the \ntrough farther displaced from our area, mainly to the northeast then \neast. Only the GFS solution would bring a chance for rain. Given the \ndivergence in model guidance, have kept POPs out of of the ending \nperiods in the extended forecast.\n\n&&\n\n.AVIATION /16Z TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...\nHigh pressure slowly builds into the region today and tonight.\n\nMainly VFR.\n\nWinds will remain NW through the TAF period. Wind speeds around\n10 kt increase to 10-15kt with gusts around 20 kt. The gusts \ncould end up occasional and any gusts likely end in the evening.\nWinds become 10kt or less once again tonight. \n\n ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...\n\nGusts may be occasional today. \n\nOUTLOOK FOR 15Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...\n\nWednesday-Saturday: VFR.\n\nDetailed information, including hourly TAF wind component forecasts, \ncan be found at: https:/www.weather.gov/zny/n90\n\n&&\n\n.MARINE...\nBased on latest obs and guidance, all SCAs on the ocean have\nbeen discontinued. \n\nA NW flow prevails in the wake of a cold front. A pressure \ngradient exists with the cold front offshore and building high \npressure to the west. Mainly sub small craft conditions today\nwith gusts to around 20 kt. Otherwise, sub small craft \nconditions prevail through the upcoming weekend as high \npressure builds into the coastal waters.\n\n&&\n\n.HYDROLOGY...\nNo hydrological impacts are expected through the entire forecast \nperiod.\n\n&&\n\n.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...\nA high rip current risk is in place through 8 pm this evening \ndue to elevated, long period swells from Ernesto.\n\nWith a full moon earlier this week and higher astronomical \ntides lingering expect minor coastal flood benchmarks to be \napproached or slightly exceeded for tonight's high tide cycle \nacross SW CT and the south shore bays of Nassau and Queens. This\nis being handled with coastal flood statements. Elsewhere minor\nbenchmarks are not expected to be approached.\n\n&&\n\n.OKX WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...\nCT...None.\nNY...High Risk for Rip Currents until 8 PM EDT this evening for NYZ075-\n     080-081-178-179.\nNJ...None.\nMARINE...Small Craft Advisory until 2 PM EDT this afternoon for ANZ350.\n     Small Craft Advisory until noon EDT today for ANZ353-355.\n\n&&\n\n$$\n\nUPDATE..DW\nAVIATION...20 \n"
