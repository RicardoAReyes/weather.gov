The exception to this will be across \nthe far southeast big bend where lingering moisture will allow for a \nslight chance of showers and thunderstorms to continue. Although \nhigh temperatures are still expected to be above average, the drier \nairmass will keep peak heat index values generally in the 95-100 \ndegree range for most of the area this afternoon. The exception will \nbe along the immediate coast and across the southeast big bend where \npeak heat indices in the low 100s are still expected this afternoon.\n\nFor tonight, mostly clear skies with dry conditions are expected \nareawide with near average overnight low temperatures ranging from \nthe upper 60s across the northwest to mid 70s across the southeast \nbig bend.\n\n&&\n\n.SHORT TERM...\n(Wednesday through Thursday night)\nIssued at 321 AM EDT Tue Aug 20 2024\n\nUpper trough over the Great Lakes will continue \nsliding off to the Northeast with a lingering shortwave in its wake \nover much of the US Southeast as a piece of vorticity may break off \nfrom the parent trough. An upper cutoff low may develop as a result \nin the short term, though guidance indicates that this may be \ndelayed into the weekend. Regardless, this will serve to pump more \nmoisture into the region increasing PoPs across our FL counties, \nparticularly across the Big Bend. Daytime highs will be in the upper \n80s to low 90s with overnight lows in the upper 60s to low 70s. \n\n\n&&\n\n.LONG TERM...\n(Friday through Monday)\nIssued at 321 AM EDT Tue Aug 20 2024\n\nThe aforementioned upper cutoff low should form by \nSaturday, gradually retrogressing west toward the Southern Plains. \nPoPs should generally remain the same each day with elevated chances \nfor rain across our FL counties with an emphasis toward the FL Big \nBend, perhaps creeping up into our SW GA counties. With the slow \nmovement of the upper low, our area will likely be stuck in this \npattern throughout the majority of the long term forecast, if not \nentirely. Daytime highs will range from the low to mid 90s with \novernight lows in the low to mid 70s. \n\n&&\n\n.AVIATION...\n(06Z TAFS)\nIssued at 103 AM EDT Tue Aug 20 2024\n\nVFR conditions are expected to prevail through the period with winds \nless than 10 knots. Some brief, TEMPO MVFR visibilities are possible \nearly this morning around TLH and VLD. \n\n&&\n\n.MARINE...\nIssued at 321 AM EDT Tue Aug 20 2024\n\nBuoy 42036 has been showing wind speeds less than 12kts for \nthe past three hours, indicating that winds have begun to calm down \nwith cautionary conditions subsiding. Winds are expected to be calm \nand variable throughout today before becoming a gentle easterly \nbreeze develops on Thursday. An easterly surge may occur once again \nas we approach Friday with cautionary conditions possible once \nagain. Wave heights will generally remain around one foot through \nFriday before becoming around 2 to 3 feet. \n\n&&\n\n.FIRE WEATHER...\nIssued at 321 AM EDT Tue Aug 20 2024\n\nThe only fire concerns are high dispersions this afternoon west of \nthe Apalachicola River extending from Southern AL down to the FL \nPanhandle I-10 corridor in the wake of a front fostered by 5kft-\n7kft+ mixing heights. Rain chances then increase each successive day \nas moisture rebounds and winds turn more easterly.\n\n&&\n\n.HYDROLOGY...\nIssued at 321 AM EDT Tue Aug 20 2024\n\nMadison County Areal Flood Warning Update: Emergency \nManagement continues to report gradually rising water levels in \nportions of southeastern Madison County east of Lee and areas around \nUS 90 as well as areas south of I-10 east of State Road 53 and the \nSuwannee River. Water levels remain high in the vicinity of I-10 and \nexit 262, but flood waters are not impacting access to or travel on \nI-10. Flood waters are continuing to gradually shift slowly south \nand east toward the Suwannee River. \n\nThe slow-responding Suwannee is in the process of a prolonged and \nflat crest in minor flood. The latest river forecasts call for a \nvery slow fall through minor flood stage over the next 7 days.\n\nDrier conditions will persist today, though a return to a wetter \npattern appears likely in the extended with our FL counties \nappearing favored. Generally less than in inch is expected areawide \nthrough Monday. \n\n&&\n\n.SPOTTER INFORMATION STATEMENT...\n\nSpotter activation is not requested.
