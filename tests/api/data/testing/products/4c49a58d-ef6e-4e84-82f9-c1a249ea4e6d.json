This will lead to a calm, quiet night\nacross the forecast area with lows in the upper 60s and lower 70s.\nHowever, some patchy fog cannot be ruled out near the I-75\ncorridor. A little bit of moisture returns on the easterly or \nnortheasterly flow on Wednesday, which will lead to some showers \nand storms near the I-75 corridor and Suwannee Valley, but rain \nchances are generally 40 percent or less. Highs will be in the \nlower to middle 90s, but the lower dew points will constrain the \nheat index values to 100 or less.\n\n&&\n\n.SHORT TERM...\n(Wednesday night through Thursday night)\nIssued at 221 PM EDT Tue Aug 20 2024\n\nA shortwave will round the base of the trough over the eastern US\nWednesday night into Thursday. PWATs will also increase to 1.6 to\n1.8 inches. This shortwave along with increasing moisture will \nlead to high rain chances, mainly over the southern and eastern \nparts of the area Thursday afternoon. There is some possibility of\nstrong storms Thursday given about 15 to 20 kt of deep layer \nshear and ample DCAPE with mid-level dry air lingering. The added \ncloud cover will drop highs into the upper 80s to lower 90s. Lows \nwill be in the lower half of the 70s.\n\n&&\n\n.LONG TERM...\n(Friday through Monday)\nIssued at 221 PM EDT Tue Aug 20 2024\n\nDeterministic and ensemble guidance suggests the shortwave may\npinch off from the main trough and meander over the northern Gulf\nthis weekend, which will keep rain chances up a bit through the\nweekend. However, guidance does differ on how much moisture\nremains in the area as some northeasterly flow tries to become\nre-established over the area. Regardless, the best rain chances\nwill generally remain across the southern and eastern parts of the\nforecast area. Highs will be in the upper 80s in the east to the\nmid 90s in the west. Lows will be in the low to mid 70s.\n\nNext week, ridging will build across much of the southern US,\nwhich will lead to a reduction in rain chances and an increase in\ntemperatures. Highs will return to the mid to upper 90s with lows\nin the mid 70s. There will still be just enough dry air that our\nheat index values will still remain around 100-105.\n\n&&\n\n.AVIATION...\n(18Z TAFS)\nIssued at 121 PM EDT Tue Aug 20 2024\n\nVFR conditions are expected over the next 24 hours. Some patchy\nfog is possible near VLD around daybreak, but confidence is too\nlow to make any categorical changes. Winds will veer from out of\nthe NW this afternoon to out of the NE on Wednesday.\n\n&&\n\n.MARINE...\nIssued at 221 PM EDT Tue Aug 20 2024\n\nGenerally light and variable winds are expected over the next 24\nto 36 hours before becoming more predominantly easterly late in\nthe week into the weekend. With this pattern, some nocturnal\neasterly surges are possible, which may result in bouts of cautionary\nconditions during the overnight hours. Seas will be around 1 to 3\nfeet. Chances for showers and thunderstorms will also increase\nthrough the period.\n\n&&\n\n.FIRE WEATHER...\nIssued at 221 PM EDT Tue Aug 20 2024\n\nGenerally east to northeast transport winds will prevail Wednesday\nthrough Friday with good to excellent dispersions across the area\neach day. Min RH values will be in the mid-30s to mid-40s\nWednesday, increasing each day. Rain chances will also increase\neach day, generally over southern and eastern parts of the area.\nOverall, fire weather concerns remain low.\n\n&&\n\n.HYDROLOGY...\nIssued at 221 PM EDT Tue Aug 20 2024\n\nAreal flooding continues across southeastern Madison County as the\nflood waters continue to shift generally eastward toward the\nSuwannee River. Additional rainfall could exacerbate issues going\nforward.\n\nThe lower Suwannee remains in minor flood, but all points are now\nfalling. This will continue to be a slow fall over the next 5-7\ndays. Additional rainfall over the next 7 days will not cause any\nadditional river flooding.\n\nFlash flooding is not a significant concern either over the next 7\ndays. But, locally heavy rainfall cannot be ruled out in any\nslow-moving storms.\n\n&&\n\n.SPOTTER INFORMATION STATEMENT...\n\nSpotter activation is not requested.
