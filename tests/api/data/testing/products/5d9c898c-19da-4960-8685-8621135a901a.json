At the same time, high pressure over the Great \nLakes will nudge ever so slowly east toward the area and become \nthe predominate feature by the end of the week. Low pressure \nwill be near or over the area Sunday into Monday with a weak \ncold front. High pressure follows on Tuesday. \n\n&&\n\n.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM WEDNESDAY MORNING/...\nThis will be a relatively benign period of weather as we head \nthrough the rest of the week. An upper low descends across \nUpstate NY tonight, but remains north of the area. A subsident \nNW flow off the Catskills should keep skies mostly clear tonight\nwith occasional NW gusts 15 up to 20 mph. Lows will be about 7 \nto 10 degrees below normal, generally in the 50s. A few of the \nnormally colder spots may drop into the upper 40s.\n\n&&\n\n.SHORT TERM /6 AM WEDNESDAY MORNING THROUGH THURSDAY/...\nThe upper low passes just north of the area on Wednesday and\nthen gradually lifts to the north across northern New England\ninto Thursday. Steepening lapse rates and cyclonic flow should\nresult in increasing clouds late morning into the afternoon \nwith an isolated shower possible, mainly across the interior. \nIt will remain unseasonably cool with temperatures in the upper \n60s to lower 70s. A few spots may get into the mid 70s. Occasional\ngusts from the WNW up to 20 mph will continue, mainly in the \nafternoon. Not much change expected Wednesday night into Thursday\nwith a less cloud cover and dry conditions. Temperatures will \nbe slightly warmer on Thursday. \n\n&&\n\n.LONG TERM /THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...\nA trough aloft exits east Thursday night into Friday as ridging \nmoves in from the west. Surface high pressure builds in from the \nGreat Lakes around this time frame. A weak ridge aloft with surface \nhigh pressure remains over the region through Saturday. \n\nWarm air advection is expected to gradually occur Friday into \nSaturday with winds turning from northwest to south and west on \nFriday and remaining that way on Saturday. This will lead to high \ntemperatures returning to the 80s, closer to climatological \naverages. Dewpoints will also increase Friday into Saturday with the \ninfluence of the onshore flow. Overall, it should remain dry and \nmostly sunny Friday and Saturday due to general subsidence over the \nregion from high pressure. \n\nAfter Saturday, global models diverge on their solutions of a low \npressure system that may descend from Quebec on Sunday. The GFS \nresolves a deepening low pressure system with a deepening trough \naloft in New England on Sunday and into our area Monday, bringing a \nweak cold front Monday afternoon/evening, then exiting to the \nsoutheast on Tuesday. Should this solution transpire, expecting \nisolated to scattered showers and thunderstorms Monday afternoon and \nevening. The GDPS and ICON have a similar solution to the GFS, \nexcept with a weaker low low, which would minimize rain coverage. \nGiven the divergence in model guidance, have kept POPs 15-20% for \nthe area Monday afternoon/evening. Dry weather is likely to follow \non Tuesday. \n\n&&\n\n.AVIATION /20Z TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...\nHigh pressure slowly builds into the region through the period.\n\nVFR.\n\nWind speeds around 10-15kt with occasional gusts around 20 kt \nthrough this afternoon. The gusts will likely end this evening with \nwinds remaining out of the NW around 10kt or less tonight, then \nbetween 10-15 kt on Wednesday.\n\n ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...\n\nGusts end times may be off by 1-2 hours. \n\nOUTLOOK FOR 18Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...\n\nWednesday-Sunday: VFR.\n\nDetailed information, including hourly TAF wind component forecasts, \ncan be found at: https:/www.weather.gov/zny/n90\n\n&&\n\n.MARINE...\nWith high pressure slowly building in from the west through the\nend of the week, expect sub small craft conditions through the \nupcoming weekend.\n\n&&\n\n.HYDROLOGY...\nNo hydrological impacts are expected through the entire forecast \nperiod.\n\n&&\n\n.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...\nA high rip current risk is in place through 8 pm this evening \ndue to elevated, long period swells from Ernesto. The risk \ndecreases to moderate on Wednesday and then low on Thursday as \nswells diminish. \n\nWith a full moon earlier this week and higher astronomical \ntides lingering expect minor coastal flood benchmarks to be \napproached or slightly exceeded for tonight's high tide cycle \nacross SW CT and the south shore bays of Nassau and Queens. This\nis being handled with coastal flood statements. Elsewhere, \nminor benchmarks are not expected to be approached.\n\n&&\n\n.OKX WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...\nCT...None.\nNY...High Risk for Rip Currents until 8 PM EDT this evening for NYZ075-\n     080-081-178-179.\nNJ...None.\nMARINE...None.\n\n&&\n\n$$\n\nSYNOPSIS...BR/DW\nNEAR TERM...DW\nSHORT TERM...DW\nLONG TERM...BR\nAVIATION...20\nMARINE...BR/DW\nHYDROLOGY...BR/DW\nTIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...\n"
