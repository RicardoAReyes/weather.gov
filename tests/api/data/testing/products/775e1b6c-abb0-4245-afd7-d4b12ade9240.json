We will continue to see \nresidual effects with isolated showers and storms through the day as \nwell as some marine hazards over the eastern gulf waters and local \nbeaches. Will be removing the storm surge warnings for the Nature \nCoast and west central Florida later this morning. No other \nsignificant changes needed to forecast at this time. \n\n&&\n\n.AVIATION...\n(12Z TAFS)\nIssued at 948 AM EDT Fri Sep 27 2024\n\nMostly VFR conditions will prevail at all terminals this morning. \nConditions will continue to improve this morning as Helene moves \nfurther north away from the area, but scattered convection will \ncontinue to be possible at the southwest Florida TAF sites of PGD, \nFMY, and RSW. Gusty southwest winds at 10 to 15 knots with gusts to \n25 knots continue through the afternoon, then decreasing less than \n10 knots by the evening.\n\n&&\n\n.MARINE...\nIssued at 948 AM EDT Fri Sep 27 2024\n\nHazardous marine conditions continue across the eastern gulf waters \nthis morning with gusty SW winds around 20-25 knots and seas around \n8-12 feet. Will continue the Small Craft Advisory through early \nSaturday morning, then decreasing below Advisory level for the \nremainder of the weekend. Boaters should still exercise caution as \nresidual seas will be slower to abate below 7 feet. Improving \nconditions continue into the beginning of the week with more \nfavorable boating conditions likely into next week.\n\n&&\n\n.PRELIMINARY POINT TEMPS/POPS...\nTPA  89  79  88  78 /  10  10  50  40 \nFMY  90  80  90  79 /  50  60  80  40 \nGIF  92  77  91  77 /  20  20  70  30 \nSRQ  90  79  89  78 /  20  30  60  50 \nBKV  89  74  90  74 /  10  10  40  30 \nSPG  90  82  89  81 /  10  20  50  50 \n\n&&\n\nSea Breeze Thunderstorm Regime For Friday: 5\nSea Breeze Thunderstorm Regime For Saturday: 5\n\nFor additional information on sea breeze regimes, go to: \n     https://www.weather.gov/tbw/ThunderstormClimatology\n\n&&\n\n.TBW WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...\nFL...Storm Surge Warning for Coastal Citrus-Coastal Hernando-Coastal \n     Hillsborough-Coastal Levy-Coastal Manatee-Coastal Pasco-\n     Pinellas. \n\nGulf waters...Small Craft Advisory until 2 AM EDT Saturday for Charlotte \n     Harbor and Pine Island Sound-Coastal waters from Bonita \n     Beach to Englewood FL out 20 NM-Coastal waters from \n     Englewood to Tarpon Springs FL out 20 NM-Coastal waters \n     from Tarpon Springs to Suwannee River FL out 20 NM-Tampa \n     Bay waters-Waters from Bonita Beach to Englewood FL out 20 \n     to 60 NM-Waters from Englewood to Tarpon Springs FL out 20 \n     to 60 NM-Waters from Tarpon Springs to Suwannee River FL \n     out 20 to 60 NM.\n\n\n&&\n\n$$\n\nUPDATE/AVIATION/MARINE...Wynn \nDECISION SUPPORT/UPPER AIR...ADavis\n"
