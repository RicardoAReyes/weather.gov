Otherwise, updates don't appear necessary this evening, the\nforecast is on track.\n\n&&\n\n.NEAR TERM...\n(Through Tuesday)\nIssued at 422 PM EDT Mon Aug 19 2024\n\nAfternoon satellite and surface observations show a well-defined \nupper trough sliding across the Carolinas with an attendant frontal \nboundary extending to the Northern Gulf Coast. These features will \nfurther advect an unseasonably dry continental airmass southward. \nTherefore, isolated convection focusing this afternoon ahead of the \nfront along the Eastern FL Big Bend into the Suwannee Valley should \nwither or exit the region tonight.\n\nSkies look to clear from SW to NE this evening into the early \nmorning hrs, thus paving the way for some radiational cooling under \nlight north winds. Forecast low temperatures are upper 60s to low \n70s away from the immediate coast - near normal for late August. \nHowever, when factoring in widespread mid 60s to near 70F dew points \nthese conditions should be a welcome change by many of us.\n\nFor tomorrow, mostly sunny skies will make for a toasty, but \nrelatively comfortable afternoon thanks to noticeably reduced \nhumidity. Effective mixing of widespread sub-70s dewpoints is \nexpected to keep heat indices mostly below triple digits while \nambient temperatures max out in the low-mid 90s.\n\n&&\n\n.SHORT TERM...\n(Tuesday night through Wednesday night)\nIssued at 422 PM EDT Mon Aug 19 2024\n\nMostly clear to partly cloudy and dry conditions expected as \nnorthwest flow continues to advect relatively drier air into the \nregion throughout the short term. Any shower and storm activity is\nexpected to remain offshore or along the FL Big Bend as a frontal\nboundary sags across our waters.\n\nExpect overnight lows generally in the low to mid 70s with daytime\nhighs generally in the 90s.\n\n&&\n\n.LONG TERM...\n(Thursday through Sunday)\nIssued at 422 PM EDT Mon Aug 19 2024\n\nThe persistent upper level trough will finally begin \nto lift to the north with the ridge centered over the southern \nplains gradually building to the east. As the trough lifts, a piece \nof vorticity may break off and spin up an upper cutoff low which \nwill serve to push more moisture back into the area. This will \nmainly increase shower and thunderstorm chances for our FL Big Bend \nand SW GA counties in the extended with probabilities increasing in \nour western zones later on as the low retrogresses west.\n\nExpect overnight lows generally in the low to mid 70s with daytime\nhighs generally in the 90s.\n\n&&\n\n.AVIATION...\n(00Z TAFS)\nIssued at 734 PM EDT Mon Aug 19 2024\n\nIsold TSRA are located around TLH and VLD attm moving slowly east.\nKept VCTS through 01Z at which time convection should be east of\nthe sites. Beyond this, VFR should prevail much of the night. As\nrain was in the area of TLH/VLD, have tempo MVFR vsbys 09-13Z.\nOther TAF sites will remain VFR. Northwesterly flow and dry air\nbehind a frontal passage should keep convection well south and\neast of the area Tuesday with VFR through the afternoon.\n\n&&\n\n.MARINE...\nIssued at 422 PM EDT Mon Aug 19 2024\n\nCautionary conditions remain in place through this evening with seas \nreaching 2 to 3 feet before conditions improve tomorrow. Chances for \nshowers and thunderstorms exist each day over our waters, \nparticularly in the morning and overnight hours, with gusty and \nerratic winds near and within these storms. \n\n&&\n\n.FIRE WEATHER...\nIssued at 422 PM EDT Mon Aug 19 2024\n\nDry weather is expected tomorrow under northerly winds and mostly \nsunny skies. Although conditions will be hot, the notably lower \nhumidity should keep peak heat indices mostly below 100 degrees.\n \nThe only fire concerns are high dispersions Tuesday afternoon west \nof Apalachicola River extending from Southern AL down to the FL \nPanhandle I-10 corridor in the wake of a front fostered by 5kft-\n7kft+ mixing heights.\n\nRain chances then increase each successive day as moisture rebounds \nand winds turn more easterly. Trends continue to point towards a \nwetter pattern late this week. Therefore, the potential for \nthunderstorms with wetting rains should grow.\n\n&&\n\n.HYDROLOGY...\nIssued at 141 PM EDT Mon Aug 19 2024\n\nMadison County Areal Flood Warning Update: \nEmergency Management continues to report gradually rising water \nlevels in portions of southeastern Madison County east of Lee and \nareas around US 90 as well as areas south of I-10 east of State \nRoad 53 and the Suwannee River. Water levels remain high in the \nvicinity of I-10 and exit 262, but flood waters are not impacting \naccess to or travel on I-10. Flood waters are continuing \nto gradually shift slowly south and east toward the Suwannee \nRiver. \n\nThe slow-responding Suwannee is in the process of a prolonged and\nflat crest in minor flood. The latest river forecasts call for a \nvery slow fall through minor flood stage over the next 7 days.\n\nDrier conditions will resume over the next few days following \nthis evenings showers and thunderstorms. Later this week, the wet \npattern may develop once again.\n\n&&\n\n.SPOTTER INFORMATION STATEMENT...\n\nSpotter activation is not requested.
