Eventually, the front will push south of the area on \nWednesday as high pressure nudges in from the northwest. The \nfront then lifts back into the area Thursday into Friday, \nfollowed by a cold frontal passage on Saturday. Tropical \nmoisture associated with tropical cyclone Debby will interact \nwith both of these boundaries.\n\nPlease refer to the latest official forecast on Debby from the \nNational Hurricane Center.\n\n&&\n\n.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...\nA severe thunderstorm watch is in effect until 1100 PM EDT for \nportions of the lower Hudson Valley, and northeastern New \nJersey, with damaging wind gusts the primary threat.\n\nA frontal boundary, through northern New Jersey into the Long\nIsland Sound will remain in the vicinity through tonight as\nwaves of low pressure track along this boundary, with the\npotential for a few stronger thunderstorms with damaging winds \nand heavy rainfall.\n\nThere is some uncertainty regarding how long the front will \nstall and how far south it will push before stalling.\n\nSignificant tropical moisture is expected to feed along the \nfrontal boundary, which will increase coverage of the showers \nand thunderstorms. Have gone with 70-80%+ POPs for this evening \nand early tonight. Widespread PWATs above 2 inches are expected \nthrough this afternoon and into tonight. \n\nLate afternoon into tonight almost all guidance shows warm air \nadvection and FGEN aloft in tandem with strong vertical velocities \nand positive vorticity advection at both 700mb and 500mb. This will \nact to enhance rainfall rates in the anomalously moist \nenvironment, leading to scattered instances of flash flooding. \nThe most likely timing for the highest rainfall rates will be \nroughly from 2pm to 2am, but this may change depending on the \nfront's progression. The 00Z HREF 10-km neighborhood probability is\nshowing decent 40-50% chances for >1\"/hr rainfall rates for \nparts of NE NJ, NYC metro, and Long Island. 1-2 inch/hr rates \nare expected in some of the strongest forced showers and \nthunderstorms. A Flood Watch will be in effect for the entire \nCWA 2PM Today through Noon Wednesday. WPC also has upgraded to \na moderate risk of excessive rainfall for NE NJ, NYC metro, and \nwestern Long Island and maintained their slight risk for the \nrest of the CWA.\n\nThunderstorm coverage may be somewhat scattered at the onset \nthis afternoon, but the environment should stabilize somewhat \ntonight, leading to decreasing thunderstorm chances as we get \ninto Wednesday.\n\nToday will be warm and muggy with high humidity and highs in \nthe low- 90s to upper-80s for NE NJ, NYC metro and western Long \nIsland. All other areas will see highs in the low-80s to \nupper-70s.\n\n&&\n\n.SHORT TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/...\nEventually, high pressure moving east in Canada will nudge in to our \nnorthwest. This, in turn, may push the stalled front to our south \ninto the day on Wednesday. This solution has less of a consensus \namong models and could lead to some variability in rainfall for \nWednesday depending on the front's location. \n\nIn the early morning hours tomorrow, the stalled frontal \nboundary is expected to push south of the CWA, aided by high \npressure nudging in from the northwest. This will lead to \ndecreasing coverage of showers Wednesday afternoon and evening. \n\nWednesday night, only isolated shower coverage is expected for \nnorthern portions of the CWA, but southern portions of the CWA \nmay still see scattered showers due to the closer proximity to \nthe stalled front to the south. This, however, is subject to \nchange. \n\nIf the front does end up south of the area as expected, then \nthe highest axis of moisture and forcing will also be fixated to\nthe south, which may lead to less instances of heavy rainfall \non Wednesday. This would not completely negate flash flood \nconcerns on Wednesday, but the threat would not be as \nsignificant compared to Tuesday evening and Tuesday night. Its \nmore likely concerns would be isolated and dependent on the \nareas that saw the most rainfall Tuesday evening & night. \n\nWith a cold front south of us on Wednesday and plenty of rain- \ncooled air and cloud cover, high temperatures will be limited to\nthe low/mid-70s.\n\n&&\n\n.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...\nKey Points:\n\n* Potential remains for a moderate to high impact flooding event\n  late Thursday into Saturday as multiple frontal systems \n  interact with tropical moisture associated with Debby.\n\n* The future track of Debby, and larger scale weather systems \n  influencing the storm's track, will play a big part in how this \n  portion of the forecast unfolds. Refer to the latest official \n  forecasts from the National Hurricane Center. \n\nNot much change with the 00Z globals as the GFS continues to\nlinger the circulation of Debby too long over the Southeast and\nthen shear it out when finally moving northeast late Friday into\nthe the first half of this weekend. However, the ECMWF/Canadian\nwhile quicker are becoming similar in that the low becomes \nabsorbed into the mid latitude cold front approaching from the \nwest. This results in less of defined circulation as the low \nworks across the area Saturday. \n\nEven before the actual circulation of Debby (no matter what its \nclassification) approaches, we may have to deal with a tropical \npredecessor heavy rainfall event on Friday as a leading warm front \napproaches from the south, with good southerly moisture transport \nand possibly enhanced lift via weakly coupled jet streaks, one \ndeparting over New England and and another riding up the coast.\nIn addition, a cold front associated with an amplifying upper\ntrough across the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley states sends a\nstrong cold front across the area on Saturday, interacting with\nthe tropical moisture and producing another potential round of \nheavy rain. Deterministic/ensemble QPF's continue to bear this \nout, showing fairly high probabilities of 4+ inches of total \nrainfall through the weekend centered over the CWA or in areas \njust north.\n\nAll the above are still highly uncertain and subject to changes\nin the future track and status of Debby as the circulation \neventually comes northward. \n\nDaytime highs should run below normal through Sat, then rebound \ncloser to normal for Sunday and Monday as rain chances decrease.\n\n&&\n\n.AVIATION /18Z TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...\n***Potential High Impact Day*** \n\nA slow moving cold front sags southeast into the area today, \nstalling nearby through tonight as a frontal wave tracks along\nit.\n\nVFR conditions with occasional MVFR ceilings through this \nafternoon as showers and thunderstorms develop and increase in \ncoverage. IFR conditions are then likely to develop north of the\nfront tonight, especially across the Lower Hudson Valley and CT\nterminals, then working south across the NYC and LI terminals. \nAirmass stabilizes from north to south late this afternoon into\ntonight. Showers will likely linger across the area overnight \nwith thunderstorm chances becoming more limited to the coastal \nterminals. \n\nWinds will be tricky as the front settles south across the area\nthis afternoon with mainly S-SW winds. A seabreeze develops across\nthe NYC and LI terminals before the front passes through late this\nafternoon. Winds will become E/NE around 10 kt late this \nafternoon, and then more northerly late tonight. However, multiple\nfrontal waves tracking along the front across the area tonight \ncould result in significant variability in wind direction.\n\n ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...\n\nAmendments are highly likely today for the timing of wind shifts,\nflight categories, and showers and thunderstorms.\n\nChance of IFR tonight.\n\nWinds may vary significantly in direction overnight as multiple\nwaves of low pressure move across the area. Low confidence in\nwind direction.\n\nOUTLOOK FOR 18Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...\n\nWednesday and Thursday : MVFR or lower in SHRA.\n\nFriday: MVFR/IFR in SHRA. SE gust 20-25kt possible. \n\nSaturday: MVFR/IFR in RA/SHRA. E to NE gusts 20-25kt possible.\n\nSunday: VFR. \n\nDetailed information, including hourly TAF wind component forecasts, \ncan be found at: https:/www.weather.gov/zny/n90\n\n&&\n\n.MARINE...\nNo changes to the winds and seas at this time.\n\nSub small craft conditions are anticipated through Tuesday \nnight. Another period of marginal small craft conditions may \ntake place on Wednesday for the ocean waters as ocean seas hover\naround 4 ft and wind gusts to 20 kt or thereabouts.\n\nThere is quite a bit of uncertainty for the end of the week due to \nthe future track of Debby. Long period southerly swells may start \narriving Thursday into Friday, but at this time seas are kept right \naround 4 ft. Seas should increase above 5 ft Fri night, and if the \ncirculation center of Debby passes to the west, gale force wind \ngusts may be possible late Fri night into Sat. The forecast could \nsignificantly change, so please refer to latest forecast information \nfrom the NHC as a starting point.\n\n&&\n\n.HYDROLOGY...\nA Flood Watch is in effect from 200 PM EDT this afternoon\nthrough Noon Wednesday. WPC has upgraded to a moderate risk of \nexcessive rainfall for today and tonight for NE NJ, NYC metro, \nand western Long Island, and has maintained a slight risk for \nthe rest of the CWA. Heavy to potentially torrential rainfall \nappears likely along a stalled front. This gives us a \nheightened potential of localized to scattered instances of \nflash flooding with 1 to 2 inch per hour rain rates possible, \nespecially for the more urban locales. The most likely location \nfor the highest rain rates will be for southern portions of the \nCWA. There remains a chance that locally heavy rainfall \ncontinues into a portion of Wednesday morning before the stalled\nfront pushes further south of the area.\n\nHeavy rainfall is possible late this week into the weekend, first \nfrom Thu night into Fri as a warm front lifting northward into the \narea interacts with tropical moisture well in advance of Debby, then \nfrom Fri night into Sat if the circulation of Debby passes close\nby.\n\n&&\n\n.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...\nA high rip current risk should continue into this evening per \nRCMOS and NWPS guidance. This is due to southerly swells of \naround 4 feet. A moderate risk is forecast for Wed as swells \nstart to diminish.\n\n&&\n\n.OKX WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...\nCT...Flood Watch through Wednesday morning for CTZ005>012.\nNY...Flood Watch through Wednesday morning for NYZ067>075-078>081-\n     176>179.\n     High Risk for Rip Currents until 9 PM EDT this evening for NYZ075-\n     080-081-178-179.\nNJ...Flood Watch through Wednesday morning for NJZ002-004-006-\n     103>108.\nMARINE...None.\n\n&&\n\n$$\n\nSYNOPSIS...BR/DW\nNEAR TERM...BR/MET\nSHORT TERM...BR\nLONG TERM...DW\nAVIATION...20\nMARINE...BR/MET/DW\nHYDROLOGY...BR/DW\nTIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...\n"
