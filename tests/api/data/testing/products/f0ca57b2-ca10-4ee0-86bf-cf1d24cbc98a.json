High pressure \nthen slowly builds in from the Great Lakes Tuesday into Tuesday \nnight. Weak New England low pressure on Wednesday. High pressure\nmoves in Wednesday night from the Great Lakes and remains the \npredominate feature through Saturday night. High pressure may \nlose hold as weak low pressure passes to our north Sunday into \nMonday.\n\n&&\n\n.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM TUESDAY MORNING/...\nThe cold front has passed east of the area and will continue\nmoving offshore through the rest of the night. Earlier broken\nline of showers/storms has weakened across eastern CT. The\nthreat for locally heavy downpours has ended. \n\nDrier air will work its way into the region tonight. \nStrengthening winds in the upper levels with a jet streak will \noccur overnight which could support some light showers or \nsprinkles, especially with the axis of the upper trough to our \nwest. Otherwise, lows overnight expected to be mainly in the \nupper 50s to mid 60s. Dew points will be falling into the 50s\ntowards day break.\n\n\n&&\n\n.SHORT TERM /6 AM TUESDAY MORNING THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT/...\nTuesday will feature slow moving and weakening low pressure \nwithin the Canadian Maritimes that will keep the cold front from\nmoving too far offshore. Further weakening of this low is \nexpected Tuesday night.\n\nRelatively cooler temperatures are forecast Tuesday and Tuesday\nnight. Forecast highs mainly in the 70s and forecast lows \nmainly in the upper 40s to around 60. The forecast highs are \naround 5 degrees below normal and the forecast lows are around 5\nto 10 degrees below normal.\n\nA westerly flow will be maintained across the region but is not\nexpected to be too gusty. Much drier air is expected as \ndewpoints lower into upper 40s to mid 50s across much of the \nregion. Dry weather expected for Tuesday through Tuesday night.\n\nUsed consensus of MOS and NBM for temperatures.\n\n&&\n\n.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...\nCooler and drier air remains in place on Wednesday with a trough and \nstrong cold air advection aloft. 850mb temps will be 7-10C below \naverage at around 6-4C with a northwesterly flow at the surface. \nThis will make it feel like a false start to fall with highs on \nWednesday in the mid-70s to upper-60s followed by Wednesday night \nlows in the 50s. \n\nShowers and thunderstorms are also possible Wednesday afternoon and \nevening. There are several factors working both for and against the \nchance for rain on Wednesday. We've got a weak surface low in New \nEngland with a surface trough expecting to extend across the area \nthat may provide a source of lift for shower and thunderstorm \ndevelopment. We've also got  vorticity advection along the \n500mb low/trough in New England aiding in development of rain. \nHowever, cold air aloft, cooler surface temps, weak instability, and \nPWATs at or below 1 inch will work against the showers and \nthunderstorms. Expecting mainly isolated coverage with possible \nscattered coverage for far northern zones closer to the low. \n\nSurface high pressure builds into the region from the Great Lakes \nWednesday night and remains in place through Saturday. This will \nlead to an extended period of dry weather. A trough exits to the \neast on Thursday as a ridge takes over. This will lead to gradually \nwarming temperatures. NW flow continues on THursday under high \npressure which will keep temperatures on the cool side with highs in \nthe upper to low-70s. Upper-70-s to lower-80s return on Friday as \nridging builds aloft and surface winds become more westerly, \neventually southwesterly by the afternoon. Westerly to southerly \nflow continues into the weekend allowing for further warming with \nhighs in the low/mid-80s. \n\nGlobal models are not in a consensus Sunday in to Monday. The GFS \nhas a trough develop over the area, GDPS/ECMWF have the trough \nfarther displaced from our area to the northeast, ICON does not have \na trough develop and keeps us under a ridge. Only the GFS solution \nwould bring a chance for rain. Given the divergence in model \nguidance, have kept POPs out of of the ending periods in the \nextended forecast.\n\n&&\n\n.AVIATION /03Z TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...\nA cold front continues moving offshore tonight. High pressure \nslowly builds in through Tuesday night. \n\nMainly VFR. There is a chance for an isolated light shower or\nsprinkle overnight. There may also be brief periods of MVFR\nceilings around 2.5-3kft. \n\nWinds have become NW and will remain NW through the TAF period.\nWind speeds around 10 kt with some gusts 15-20 kt possible\nthrough around 04-05z. NW winds increase after day break,\nbecoming 10-15kt with gusts around 20 kt on Tuesday. The gusts \ncould end up occasional and any gusts likely end Tuesday \nevening.\n\n ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...\nGusts could linger an hour or two longer tonight. \n\nMVFR ceilings around 030 possible overnight. \n\nGusts on Tuesday may be occasional. \n\nOUTLOOK FOR 00Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...\n\nTuesday Night: A gust G15-20kt possible in the evening. VFR. \n\nWednesday-Saturday: VFR.\n\nDetailed information, including hourly TAF wind component forecasts, \ncan be found at: https:/www.weather.gov/zny/n90\n\n&&\n\n.MARINE...\nSCA conditions are expected to remain across the ocean mainly\ndue to seas through Tuesday. Otherwise, conditions will be \nbelow SCA through the upcoming weekend with high pressure\nbuilding into the region.\n\n&&\n\n.HYDROLOGY...\nNo additional hydro concerns tonight with mainly dry conditions\nto follow Tuesday through the upcoming weekend. \n\n&&\n\n.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...\nA high rip current risk is in place through Tuesday due to \nelevated, long period swells from Ernesto. \n\nOcean seas are forecast to be highest through Monday, and with \nsurf heights up to 6 ft, local beach erosion is possible.\n\nA full moon today as well as swell from distant Ernesto will \nalso elevate total water levels this week.\n\nAdditional minor flooding is possible with the high tide cycles\n(especially the evening/nighttime cycles) through much of this \nweek. Additional advisories/statements will likely be needed.\n\n&&\n\n.OKX WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...\nCT...None.\nNY...High Risk for Rip Currents through Tuesday evening for NYZ075-080-\n     081-178-179.\nNJ...None. \nMARINE...Small Craft Advisory until 6 PM EDT Tuesday for ANZ350-353-355.\n\n&&\n\n$$\n\nSYNOPSIS...JM/BR\nNEAR TERM...DS\nSHORT TERM...JM\nLONG TERM...BR\nAVIATION...DS\nMARINE...JM/BR\nHYDROLOGY...JM/BR\nTIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...\n"
