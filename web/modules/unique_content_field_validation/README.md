# Unique Content Field Validation

[Unique content field validation](https://www.drupal.org/project/unique_content_field_validation) is a module from [Fabian Sierra (fabiansierra5191)](https://www.drupal.org/u/fabiansierra5191) that allows us to ensure certain content types have unique entities. Instead of managing it through composer, we have pulled it into our weather.gov modules in order to customize it for our purposes.
